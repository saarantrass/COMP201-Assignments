Since C language does not do automatic checks for buffer overflows, we need to come up with our own solutions. One solution may be doin the boundary checks ourselves while writing the code. For this, we can use strncpy or strncat instead of strcpy sor strcat. The n versions do the boundary check which adds security. Similar thing can be seen in our example too. We can use fgets instead of scanf, or we can do boundary checks ourselves in scanf(like %100s) to avoid this vulnerabilities.These are simple fixes against a buffer overflow. We can also use advanced techniques like stack canaries or ASLR etc.
